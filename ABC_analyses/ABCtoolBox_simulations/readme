#To launch the simulations

./launch_ABCtoolBox.sh

Notes: 
1- the script have to be adapted to the cluster queuing system;
2- You can run in parallel each scenario to get simulations quicker. 
Here an example to submit jobs in parallel for sc1, and then compile the outputs (out_sampling1.txt) one the simulations are done:

#1. Launch in parallel simulation for sc1 (the sc1_1 is the folder sc1 - see the ABC/ABC_simualtions/ Github folder - that you will rename sc1_1 before launching this script):

cd sc1/
for i in $(seq 2 80)
  do cp -rf sc1_1 sc1_$i
done
for i in $(seq 1 80)
  do cd sc1_$i
     sbatch submit.sh
     cd .. 
done

#2. After simulations are done : merge all your simulations into one single file "res_sc1_005.txt", for example

cd /dir/
for j in $(seq 1)
  do cd sc1_005/
     head -n 1 sc1_005_1/out_sampling1.txt > res_sc1_005.txt
        for i in $(seq 1 80)
          do tail -n +2 sc1_005_$i/out_sampling1.txt >> res_sc1_005.txt
          cp res_sc1_005.txt /dir/
        done
     cd ..
done
